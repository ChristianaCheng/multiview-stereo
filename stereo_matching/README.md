# Disparity/depthmap estimation algorithm based on Winner-Takes-All algorithm
### It supports the following photo-consistency metrics:
    SSD: sum of squared differences
    SAD: sum of absolute differences
    NCC: normalized cross correlation
    MI: mutual information
### It supports batch computation for matching cost
